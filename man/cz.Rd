\format{
A data frame with 741 rows corresponding to commuting zones (CZ) and
10 columns corresponding to the variables:

\item{czname}{Name of CZ}

\item{state}{2-digit state code}

\item{pop}{Population according to the year 2000 Census}

\item{theta25}{Fixed-effect estimate of the causal effect of living in the CZ
for one year on children's percentile rank in the national distribution of
household earnings at age 26 relative to others in the same birth cohort for
children growing up with parents at the 25th percentile of national income
distribution}

\item{theta75}{Fixed-effect estimate of the causal effect of living in the CZ
for one year on children's percentile rank in the national distribution of
