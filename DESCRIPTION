Description: Computes empirical Bayes confidence estimators and confidence
    intervals (EBCIs) in a normal means model. The EBCIs are robust in the sense
    that they achieve correct coverage regardless of the distribution of the
    means. If the means are treated as fixed, the EBCIs have an average coverage
    guarantee.
