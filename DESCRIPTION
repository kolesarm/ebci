Description: Computes empirical Bayes confidence estimators and confidence
    intervals in a normal means model. The intervals are robust in the sense
    that they achieve correct coverage regardless of the distribution of the
    means. If the means are treated as fixed, the intervals have an average
    coverage guarantee. The implementation is based on Armstrong, Kolesár and
    Plagborg-Møller (2020) <arXiv:2004.03448>.
